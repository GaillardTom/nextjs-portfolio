# Runner


## Enumeration

Output of quick ```nmap -sS runner.htb``` 

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
8000/tcp open  http-alt
```


Port 8000 is running a web server. 
Port 80 is the website of the application and looking at it nothing screams vulnerable to me just yet. 
Let's check them out thorougly.

### Dirbusting

#### Port 8000

+ http://runner.htb:8000/health (CODE:200|SIZE:3)                                                                   
+ http://runner.htb:8000/version (CODE:200|SIZE:9)    
```
As we can see not much is there on port 8000 either but it seems like it's acting as an api for the application running on port 80.
