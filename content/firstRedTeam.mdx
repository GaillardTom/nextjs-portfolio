# My Experience in a Red Team

## Introduction

The British Army hosted a Red vs Blue cyber competition called DCM4, which is one of the biggest cyber competition in western europe for NATO.
We had to attack 35 blue teams and I was part of the Red Team composed of around 110 operators. My sub team had to attack 3 different blue teams.
I had a lot of fun and learned a lot about how to attack and pivot inside an actively guarded network.
I also learned a lot about cobalt strike and was able to carry on the attack instructed to me by the team leader. 

## Range Diagram

The infrastructure was divided into multiple enclave, each one with different services and different levels of security.

- __Health__: Health Services Enclave with a web portal and HVAC system and an octoprint server. 

- __BT SOC__: Blue Team Security Operations Center

- __GOV__: Workstations and servers hosting different services for the government enclave with a SCADA system using solaris.

- __MIL__: Workstations and servers hosting different services for the military enclave with a SAT subnet. 

- __DEPS__: Workstations and servers hosting different services as well as a UAV subnet for the Secret Deployable enclave.

- __DEPO__: Workstations and servers hosting different services for the Official Deployable enclave.

## C2 Frameworks used

- Cobalt Strike (C2 Framework SPHINX) 
- Tuoni (C2 Framework LEVIATHAN)

## The Setup & Attack Campaign

The goal was to carry out missions we had been given by the team leader.  
We had access to a VPN and a big infrastructure with a lot of tools to help us carry out the attacks.
We had 2 groups, one called SPHINX and the other LEVIATHAN, using different TTPs and C2 frameworks.
I was assigned to the SPHINX group using CS. Their main goal was to act as an hacktivist group and disrupt or deface the services of the blue team.

## The Attack

#### Overview:
The attacks were separated by day with an increasing aggressivity for our campaign.
Each day there was a morning and an evening phase with a different set of missions to carry out.
Here is a summary of the attacks I carried out during the 5 days of the competition.
#### Day 1:
- Reconnaissance phase where we had to gather information about the blue team and their services.
- Accessed the hospital and gov fw.
- Accessed some systems to create local admin account and domain user onto the health and gov enclave. 
- Used Cobalt Strike to generate beacons and pivot inside the network.

#### Day 2:
- Health portal defacement
- Setup some proxy on the health and gov enclave 
- Non destructive actions on the HVAC system in health enclave 
- Health data leak 
#### Day 3:
- Deface the web portal again.
- Persistence on FWs on HEALTH, MIL and GOV enclave
- Destructive attack onto the 3d printers in the health enclave
- Destructive HVAC attack
#### Day 4 & Day 5:

Unfortunately, I was not able to participate in the last 2 days of the competition.
But from what I heard, they wreaked havoc on the blue teams, but they were able to counter us after a bit of time.


## Conclusion: 

The blue teams defended very well against our attacks and I was impressed by the level of security they had in place.
The range was very well designed (and very big) and the red team had a lot of tools at their disposal to carry
out the attacks. I had a ton of fun and learned a lot during dcm4, I am looking forward to the next edition and hope to be able to participate again.
